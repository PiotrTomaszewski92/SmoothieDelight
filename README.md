# SmoothieDelight
My single web page project.

This project is a website created in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some JQuery. This website contains several parts:
1. Header block with video, logo Making Waves company and menu
2. When you click on the subpage in the menu, it will take you to the appropriate section.
3. Two column section with text and pictures and section with header and gallery
5. In Lose Weight section I used ***sprite sheets***
    - in this section I wanted to make dynamic numbers - when the user scrolls this part, the JS mechanism starts and animates numbers from 0 to what is each subblock
6. Next section is a form that allows to choose the right type of smoothie.
7. Stay alert section shows the newest articles
8. In the end, I created newsletter section for send name and email.
9. Footer block with menu (like in header) and author data.

During implementation I used:
- Bootstrap - a very helpful framework
- JQuery framework
- Open Sans from Google font
- box shadow and border radius generator
- Stack Overflow

While I create the website, my inspiration were  food catering webpages.
Please forgive me. Unfortunately, I do not have graphic skills to create a website myself. The best solution for me is write a page using a ready PSD file.

I greet all! <3
